# Output and paging

## Doctor

`doctor` performs one bounded user-list read per selected profile with silent credential acquisition.
Without `--profile`, it checks the default profile, or all profiles if no default is set.
Missing configuration and failed reads return errors.
Ordinary commands never initiate interactive login.

Delegated read commands default to the scope for their operation, which may differ from the user-read scope in the quick start.
Sign in explicitly with the appropriate scopes before switching areas.
Read commands reject unapproved or write scopes before acquiring credentials.
Permissions, directory roles and licences vary by operation; see the [access and licence guidance](graph-coverage.md).
A 403 response alone does not identify which prerequisite is missing.

```sh
# Group membership reads
mg-axi auth login --profile soc --scopes https://graph.microsoft.com/GroupMember.Read.All
mg-axi entra group list --profile soc --limit 10
mg-axi entra group member list --profile soc --group <group-id>

# Conditional Access inspection
mg-axi auth login --profile soc --scopes https://graph.microsoft.com/Policy.Read.All
mg-axi entra conditional-access policy list --profile soc
mg-axi entra conditional-access policy show --profile soc --id <policy-id>

# Reviewed raw reads
mg-axi auth login --profile soc --scopes https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read.All,https://graph.microsoft.com/GroupMember.Read.All
mg-axi api get /users --profile soc --scopes https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read.All
mg-axi api get /groups --profile soc --odata '$filter=securityEnabled eq true&$top=5' --scopes https://graph.microsoft.com/GroupMember.Read.All
```

Raw access is not an unrestricted Graph client.
Unreviewed routes, secret-returning routes, mail/file content, beta raw reads and raw writes are refused before credentials.
Returned data is restricted to reviewed fields; completeness describes the requested collection, not full Graph property coverage.
Secret material, authentication-method phone numbers and data-policy storage locations are redacted, including in full output, previews and audit metadata.

### TOON output behavior

| Control | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--select` | Request reviewed properties where supported; some routes select locally instead |
| `--fields` | Project locally from properties already fetched |
| `--full` | Remove 500-character text truncation without lifting redaction or row caps |
| `--limit` | Cap collection rows, normally 100 by default |
| `--all` | Follow pages within request, byte and deadline budgets; incompatible with `--limit` |
| `--cursor` | Resume a partial collection under the same profile, scopes and API version |

Availability varies by leaf; consult its `--help`.
List output includes `count`, `total` and `complete` information.
For example, a partial user list without a server total reports `count: 10 users shown, more available` and `total: null`.
A known server total uses a count such as `10 of 143 users`; totals are never invented or fetched with an extra request.

Partial results preserve buffered rows and the next page in an opaque cursor.
For named reads, repeat the original query flags or omit them; conflicting queries are rejected.
Repeat `--fields` and `--full` to retain the same local view.
Raw reads reuse their original query when `--odata` is omitted on resume.
For large raw cursors, save the token to a file and supply it through stdin:

```sh
mg-axi api get /users --profile soc --cursor - --all --scopes https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read.All < cursor.txt
```

Both raw cursor input forms have a 16 MB ceiling.
Treat cursor tokens and output as tenant data.
Denied reads return structured errors, not empty success results.
